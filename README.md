🏭 XAI-Powered Air Quality Forecasting System Using DCNN-LSTM
🌍 Overview
This project presents an advanced air quality forecasting system for Tamil Nadu using deep learning (DCNN-LSTM) combined with eXplainable AI (XAI). It aims to predict key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NOx, and Ozone with high accuracy, helping governments and communities make data-driven decisions for cleaner environments.

🎯 Problem Statement
Accurate prediction of air quality is crucial to mitigate health risks and support environmental planning. However, conventional models often lack both precision and interpretability. This project bridges that gap by leveraging a deep convolutional neural network integrated with LSTM layers and XAI techniques to ensure accurate and transparent forecasts.

🧪 Project Objectives
📊 Predict pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, O3, SO2)

🧠 Use DCNN-LSTM architecture for spatiotemporal modeling

🔍 Integrate Explainable AI to interpret model decisions

📈 Analyze trends across districts in Tamil Nadu

♻️ Align with Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action)
